# DSW-County-App
Different approaches to the county app  
Version #1 is a traditional approach with several for loops and using string concatenation.  
Version #2 is a more "pythonic" approach with list comprehensions and modern f-string formatting.  
Version #3 is a more efficient approach using the dictionary data structure to avoid multiple loops.
